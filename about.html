            <h2>How We Got Here</h2>
            <p>Our studio started in the early 2010s as a small indie team of only five people. Meeting regularly at the public library; discussing, loving, and creating digital games with nothing but scraps and our power of will.</p>
            <p>With our first major project consisting of the now infamous media: <b>Pwned: the game</b></p>
            <p>Initially intended to prank another friend of ours, to be installed to his computer and spook him into thinking he had malware on his system.</p>
            <p>The main game loop consists of many WarioWare esque mini-games, each inspired by various debugging strategies, pop-ups, and other malware inspired games. All the minigames having strict time limits—with the failure to complete enough of the games leading to a "GET PWNED" game over screen.</p>
            <p>With the the success of our game pranking our friend, we realized that together, we could work towards creating more major games to be pulished for the public audience. However, what we had not expected was for that friend to alter the code to have email saving capabilities, to which led to the program with the ablility to email copies of itself to the player's contacts withing an advertising email, concealing the true game loop and nature of the game; becoming a self speading malware that caused panic to many desktops and laptops across the world.</p>
            <p>From then, we had cut ties with that friend, and had him arrested for his cyber crimes. With the <b>Pwned: the game</b> digital copy now locked in a USB that we keep locked in a physical safe.</p>
            <p>We at Paperclip Studios will be sure that an atrocity like this will never happen again.</p>
